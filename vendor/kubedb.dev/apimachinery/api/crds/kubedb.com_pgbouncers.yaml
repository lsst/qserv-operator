                        and LoadBalancer. "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName.
                        "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                        to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or
                        if that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                        object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated
                        and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                        than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates
                        a port on every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer"
                        builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if
                        supported in the current cloud) which routes to the clusterIP.
