# Andy H. still have to modify the local IP-to-Name cache to account
# for dynamic DNS (it doesn't now). Unfortunately, it's a non-ABI compatible
# change so it will go into Release 5 branch not git master. The caching
# shouldn't really be a problem but if causes you grief simply turn it off by
# also specifying "xrd.network cache 0". Once Andy H. fixes the cache it will work
# correctly with a dynamic DNS with no side-effects (though it's unlikely any of
# them are observed as it is).
